        <h2>About this application</h2>
        <p>Recipe Box is my second project built with Symfony framework, version 2.8.</p>
        <p>This software has no commercial purposes.</p>
        <p>The building process was quite challenging. The most problematic thing I dealt with was the recipe forms that include collections of other entities (ingredients and directions) and image upload (vich uploader bundle). I guess the Symfony's form builder is good enough for smaller or simpler forms but in this case, implementation of the form the way I want was too difficult, unclear, confusing (what caused problems in production).</p>
        <p>Overall it was a fun trip with Symfony - especially in localhost. Deployment to my shared hosting service was a pain in the neck though.</p>
