Recipe Box
==========

A Symfony project created on May 11, 2016, 10:45 pm.

Recipe Box is my second project built with Symfony framework, version 2.8.

This software has no commercial purposes.

The building process was quite challenging. The most problematic thing I dealt with was the recipe forms that include collections of other entities (ingredients and directions) and image upload (vich uploader bundle). I guess the Symfony's form builder is good enough for smaller or simpler forms but in this case, implementation of the form the way I want was too difficult, unclear, confusing (what caused problems in production).

Overall it was a fun trip with Symfony - especially in localhost. Deployment to my shared hosting service was a pain in the neck though.
